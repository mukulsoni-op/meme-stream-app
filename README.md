# Technologies
Project is created with:
* HTML, CSS and JS (Frontend)
* NodeJS, Express (Backend)
* MongoDB (Database)

## Functioning
The project has been made with the help of NodeJS, Express and EJS templates. The templates have been designed with the help of the Bootstrap library and local CSS file.

Using EJS is the reason why I don't have a different folder for backend and frontend
